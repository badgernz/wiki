##Can I record for YouTube or Twitch on our servers?
Of course! We do however ask that you mention us as the server that you are playing on and if possible place a link to our website in the description of your video. Unfortunately we do not have any YouTuber/Streamer ranks setup. If you have any ideas for these, please let us know!

##What are Points and how do I get them?
Points are Enjin's micropayment system. These allow you to get rewards from out online store. The easiest way to get these points is by donating. However, all players are able to get what a donator would, even if they do not choose to donate, by simply voting for the network!

All our servers run GriefPreventionPlus due to it being so easy to use for you, our players and also its effectiveness at stopping griefing!

The End also resets on the 16th of every month aswell
